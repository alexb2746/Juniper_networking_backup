# network_backups



## Summary

This is a python script that utilizes PYEZ to retreive the configuration more information here: https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos-pyez/junos-pyez-developer/topics/topic-map/junos-pyez-program-configuration-retrieving.html#id-task-configuration-retrieving-specify-format

This backs up a text version of the configuration and a set command version of juniper only devices in their respective folders

## Roadmap

For now the script has to be run manually with a password and commited. 

In the future I plan to make this a daily nightly pipeline probably utiliziating a service account.
